# Opencart-1.5.6.5_RC
Original OpenCart v.1.5.6.5_rc Release Candidate Download from the official Opencart.com Github Site

History in Short, from a distant + neutral Swiss Point of View:

Since it's Debut, Opencart v.1.5.6.5_rc was known, to be top-solid, top-secure, and fast, and not a single Topic yet exists on v.1.5.6.5 Problems, from someone using this Version, as I recall, during my ~Years of rather intense OC Forum Activity (~11'200 Topic Replies). And for me, all this makes OC v.1.5.6.5_rc still the Number One Choice, if one not only looks for Version Numbers, but simply for a proven solid and also simple to handle final Onlineshop Version Class Release!

The Version OpenCart 1.5.6.5_rc was never given 'Final v.1.5.6.5' Status officially. In plain fear of Competition, I assume, because unfamous OC v.2.0 existed for some Months already, when 1.5.6.5_rc was made public by an Official on the OC Github Developer Site. But most everything on Add-On's for 1.5.6.x. Versions existed already. So, just re-announcing a new 'final' (older) Version would have harmed the new OC v.2 Market, since OC v.1.5.6.5 would have been favoured by parts of the OC Crowd for some time to come ...

Ernie's Opencart LIGHT + V-PRO are fully built on (slightly php7/secured/upgraded) OC v.1.5.6.5 (_rc) 'System' Code. But I replaced the outdated non-responsive 1.5.6.4 default Theme with popular Bootstrap + FontAwesome styled OC Theme Extensions, making them to the 'speediest' responsive OpenCart Themes around.
